                <h2>"Overview"</h2>
                <p> The Prophet 6 is, as its name implies, a six-voice polysynth.
                It offers two VCOs per voice, but these are not recreations of
                the Prophet 5's oscillators, which offered simultaneous ramp and
                pulse/PWM waves on Osc1, and simultaneous ramp, triangle and 
                pulse/PWM waves on Osc2.</p>
